Writing in journals have been my thing for a while, but something about publishing a blog on the internet, almost in anonymity, (because really, who would find it this in the grand mass of information?) is inspiring me to try again. I think it is also because it is a snapshot that is less painful to read than my icky feelings and daily messiness. But lastly, I want to develop my own voice and this is a way to practice.
