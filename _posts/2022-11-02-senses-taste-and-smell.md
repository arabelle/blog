Last year, in August 2021, I lost my sense of smell and therefore taste for 2 months (delta variant is brutal T_T). After a month without getting better, I thought I would lose it forever. I kept visiting subreddits, news articles, trying to see when others got their senses back, looking for some hope at the end of the tunnel. Day after day I would sniff fresh coffee grounds and perfume, seeing if anything changed. Healing was not linear: one day I managed to taste tomatoes, but the next day it was gone again.

> "When you are eating all the beautiful, complicated flavors … they are all smell.” [Murthy said](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/02/how-scent-emotion-and-memory-are-intertwined-and-exploited/) you can test that theory by pinching your nose when eating something such as vanilla or chocolate ice cream. Instead of tasting the flavor, he said, “all you can taste is sweet." 

That was exactly my experience, I could taste sour, sweet, salty, but apples tasted the same as oranges.

Smell is more important to me than taste, but since they are so intertwined, I will share some notable ones below.

# Lavender
Growing up, one of the first scents I imprinted in my mind is lavender. Driving down the Oregon coast with my mom and my grandparents, visiting a lavender farm. Sunny and foggy weather, my grandparents diligently waking up every morning to do their morning stretches outside, eating takeout in our hotel room, running around on the windy beaches. Precious memories.

# Wisteria
Maybe around 7 years ago, our neighbour gifted us some body lotion for Christmas. It was one of those stereotypical gifts for acquitances you don't know that well, Wisteria from Crabtree and Evelyn. I'm not a huge body lotion person, it's usually too greasy and sticky, but this one smelled so good I decided to take it for myself. That winter I started my internship at Demonware and I distinctly remember one day I went to practice basketball in the morning at UBC, showered, put on the lotion and bused all the way to the office. During standup I was self conscious of how I smelled, was it too strong? too floral? Regardless it put me in a good mood, and I would use it almost religiously everyday. Fast forward, they discontinued this fragrance and I was devastated...Why do companies have to get rid of good products? Who can I talk to to get it back?

# Under the Lemon Trees
The first scent I bought since moving to Seattle in 2021. What a memorable summer...a whirlwind of new people, new places, new everything. I remember bringing this with me to Lake Chelan, wearing it everyday. How can a scent leave such a lasting effect in just a few short days? I remember during this trip thinking to myself "cherish your time right now because it will not last". I hate how relationships change, people change, but this scent is a snapshot that will never change. Soaking in sunshine on the boat, walking along the grass knolls, taking pictures by the beach, the big spacious house, hotpot and bbq family-style, eating chips on the couch, siting on the hammock listening to music, looking for constellations at night, eating good at the winery. Bittersweet.

# Autumn Vibes
I impulsively bought this perfume because it had autumn in the name, not a second thought. Good thing I actually liked the scent. It became the theme of New York when I visited in November 2021. One of the sunnier weeks, my first time really experiencing the city as an adult. Shopping in SoHo, walking around empty art galleries in Chelsea, goofing around on the Little Island, thrifting in Brooklyn. Going back to New York last week felt similar but completely different. I visited the same areas but separate locations, the weather was a bit foggier, rainier, colder. I went to a disconnected New York, one with people I recognize but no longer feel the same towards.

# Monorail Espresso
This is not my favourite coffee spot, probably far from it, but I am using it as an example. It was the first time I realized I could actually taste the difference in coffee roasts. Earlier this year I had visited Monorail to get lattes, fast forward a few months I went back and was transported to spring, a low time for me. I vow not to go back, not to relive it, but I was shocked the taste could do that in the first place. Another memory feature unlocked, I guess.

# Elderflower
Summer of 2011, I went on a trip to Europe with my would-be highschool classmates. It was an involved trip: England, Rome, Pompeii, Athens, Santorini. For a few 13 year olds we were given a lot of freedom: "come back to this fountain in 5 hours, goodbye". We also arranged homestays when we were in the English countryside. What a life to experience, I remember thinking "I can't believe I'm really here". The family I stayed with were so different from my own, it was fascinating to experience someone else's home life. They offered me to drink but I declined the champagne and beer. Then they pulled out something called elderflower cordial, I was intrigued. They made me a glass, pouring in sparkling water and a bit of the syrup. The first sip I was floored. Sweet and floral, light like summer. I was made to forever choose any drink with elderflower in it, unfortunately a lot of that is liqueur-based. In the same way I will chase the smells of that house, even if they are faded in my mind by now.
