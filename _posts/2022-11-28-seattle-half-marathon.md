In the beginning of September, I decided to run a half-marathon. If Iâ€™m going to be running, I might as well run for something... It was a spur of the moment idea and I quickly looked up a 12-week training plan. Calculating that the last week of November was exactly 12 weeks away, I googled marathons during that time and the [Seattle Marathon](https://www.seattlemarathon.org/) popped up. I consigned it to fate.

 As with many others, I historically hate running, but this year I started to take it seriously. At first it was just to try it out, but then I started using [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/10951514) again and became an addict. I chased the kudos, the PRs, the pace. 

Living close to South Lake Union means I get to run a very flat easy route around the bottom part of the lake, it became the path I frequented the most. Sometimes I ran wih friends around Green Lake or Discovery Park, other times I ran alone near Elliot Bay. I bought some nice running shoes, I bought earphones. I was excited to travel back home to Vancouver to run, to go to New York to run. It opened up a new way of exploring a city.

## The Journey
    
On the second week of my training plan I shattered a glass container in my kitchen and stepped on a shard. Thinking I was fine I cleaned up and proceeded to run a 5k the same day. The next few days I quickly realized something was wrong, and went to receive my first dose of American healthcare. The doctor looked at my foot, "took something out", and sent me on my way. The sharp pain never subsided and I continued to worry but did not want to shelve up another $600 so I waited to heal. Patient is not how I would describe how I felt. Those days when I could barely walk, when I was still eager to hike so I swallowed the discomfort, when I still tried to run even when I was sure I shouldn't. Every night I would check if the wound got better and it never did. It kept hurting even after it closed up. Finally, almost 2 months later, I noticed that there was in fact a piece of glass still stuck inside and my body naturally pushed it out. I was free at last.

During the time of my injury I felt straight mad. Just as I started something good, tried to achieve a goal, I got sent right back to square one. I was missing runs left and right, trying to justify it but felt like a failure. That's a lesson for life I guess, nothing has to go the way you want just because you planned it (and never take your health for granted?).

## The Lessons

I do actually love running now :) The gross sweat afterwards, the relief of finishing the run. Training gave me a schedule and a purpose and I was grateful for that.

A few things:
- the first few km are always the hardest, then you get numb, sometimes euphoric (I've only experienced runner's high twice)
- running the morning after drinking feels terrible
- running far is more of a test for your legs/feet than your heart/lungs
- I have a bad gauge for pace, and sometimes it surprises me how fast/slow I am going
- treadmills are extremely boring >:(
- [Footpath](https://footpathapp.com/) is a good app to plot routes

Other smaller obstacles:
- the forest fire smoke during the end of September/beginning of October
- breaking in my shoes before the race
  - initially I ran in Saucony Kinvara 12s which were comfortable from the get go
  - for the race I decided to go with the HOKA ONE ONE Mach 4 and it felt too narrow for my feet, they would make my feet go numb

My favourite recovery stretches to do were [foam rolling](https://youtu.be/t4A523-O5uk) and this 8-minute post-run [video](https://youtu.be/UAcO8sb7KWc).

## The Results
My goal was to run a sub-2 hour half-marathon and I achieved that, if only by a minute and 30 seconds :)

The night before the marathon I didn't sleep all that much, maybe 5 hours, and I sure did not eat the healthiest the whole month prior. We got to the starting line a little late, there were more people than I expected. We also ran to the starting line from the parking lot which added maybe 0.5 km? It was crowded and the route was narrow in a lot of areas, making it hard to pass people. I'd like to believe if I was running alone my pace would have been slightly better. I remember during the race, when I first saw the 3 mile marker, I was already dejected at how much more there was to go. Every mile marker was a surprise, it felt way longer than my training runs. I knew I was running behind on my goal time, somehow, so at the very end on my tired legs, I sprinted as fast as I could. The most difficult part of the race was running up to the UW fountain and down. I kept repeating to myself in my head "pain is temporary, pain is temporary"...the glutes and hamstrings hurt the most.

Things I definitely want to improve for next time:
- more hill training!
- better nutrition/weight management
- don't get injured...
- interval and speed training/fartleks
 
 I did successfully complete my training plan, which I am proud of:

I can almost say for certain that the training was more enjoyable than the race itself. Doing this was my way of testing my character. I wanted to see if I could set my mind to something and complete it. Even if it isn't much, I'm still proud of myself for doing it.

## What's Next?

Running a full marathon is still on my bucket list, but my goals are shifting for the season. The next thing I want to take seriously is weightlifting, but I will go back to running when I can. I'm no longer scared of it :)
