There a few things we ask ourselves once in a while. Would you rather lose your sense of smell or sense of taste? Would you rather be blind or deaf? All quite pointless, maybe even a bit tone-deaf, considering we are privileged to have these senses at the moment. Perhaps a better question is which sense is most significant to you?

While reading [Single on Purpose](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50209350), there was a section on what songs define your journey, what songs resonate with you and are significant, sentimental. Here are mine.

# [北京的冬天](https://open.spotify.com/track/3rcKoEhbFSD4x1pclOA0am?si=d900ebe8e53349f5) by 老狼
Maybe my favourite song of all time, this song never fails to comfort me, and I go back to it time and time again. Most of my songs have  been with me for a long time, and have transformed into something more. I listen to Japanese, Korean, Spanish, mostly English songs, but somehow the ones that stick with me the most are in Chinese. I think back to the songs my mom played in the car when I was young, back to my childhood. It's hard to describe why I love this song, the lyrics? The fact that I know the words? Because of the number of times I've listened to it? The imagery? I like a sad song, I'll admit, I like to reflect how I feel on the inside with what I hear on the outside. This one isn't too sad, it's more reminiscent, as if the cold has iced over the feelings and they feel more numb, at peace.

# [山海](https://open.spotify.com/track/34dK493M256BU2UFA9XJ06?si=09ea2067bc7a4d4d) by 草東沒有派對
This is a song I play on repeat when I'm frustrated, sad, angry. I yell it out, the electric guitar so satisfying, the softness in between the build ups. It de-stresses me, it gives me energy. When you have nothing left to give so you turn to the sea, so you disappear into the woods. Very dramatic, but sometimes necessary. 

# [Frank](https://open.spotify.com/track/6naWya7v9mwH3qxBotSUWC?si=d8f4eb55a54b46cc) by Jordan Bratton
Just 20 years old when he released this song...How did I find it? The beat instantly captivated me. If I ever were to create a choreo for a song, it would be this one. So many good things started from my SoundCloud playlist. When I graduated to Spotify, I only recently remembered to go back and find this gem. There's something special about revisiting a song you haven't heard in a while. I've never been huge on lyrics, but these ones hold more meaning than your usual f'n-get-drunk ones. Love is about being honest, I've realized that more so recently. History also matters, growing up together, changing from what you've known. This song reminds me of young love, when you want things to work but you also don't know much yet, learning to funnel your frustration somewhere, learning to make sense of heartbreak.


# [Loser](https://open.spotify.com/track/2vzn8usBcuNL93DnTjEK0z?si=30240045ffd0440f) by BIGBANG
I remember listening to this song on repeat, sitting at Paragon during my first internship. I felt isolated there at times, just my other intern Liran sitting next to me. Other than the Nintendo office, one sushi restaurant a walk away, and a strange food court nearby, there wasn't much else around us. The long commute to the east side, past Commercial, and rushing to get back so I could work at the sushi restaurant at Kitsilano after work. Hot summer days, I remember reading IQ84, it was fitting. My first exposure to corporate life, wanting to please, banging my head to get things to work, afraid I wasn't good enough. Maybe that's why I loved the song so much; "I'm just a loser". I wonder why I tried so hard to be a waitress, wanting to work in the service industry, cleaning toilets, not wanting to go to cheap Japanese restaurant to eat ever again now that I've seen the way the sausage was made.

# [Luv(sic)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Ii9xUwJxNVFI3FV4yCmTm?si=0839b91bd0644a4c) by Nujabes
The full set of songs never fail to make me emotional, to make me feel. The neverending beat, trudging on but transforming, taking you along, almost freestyle, but also very intentionally put together. Calculated but spontaneous like jazz, Nujabes gone too soon. To leave behind such a legacy, maybe it's harder to be a living legend. Honorable mentions go to Shiki no Uta, and the Samurai Champloo soundtrack in general.

# [Hotel California](https://open.spotify.com/track/40riOy7x9W7GXjyGp4pjAv?si=a0e2aa77cf6d49c2) by The Eagles
An oldie, a classic, not much to be said. I remember using this song for English class, it's a bit unnerving, unsettling. It reminds me a bit of another song, Spanish Romance.

# [Yesterday Once More](https://open.spotify.com/track/3wM6RTAnF7IQpMFd7b9ZcL?si=e74c7fdeb1364373) by The Carpenters
Laying in my childhood bed, listening to my MP3, and this song on repeat, singing along to my favourite songs...

# [Hollywood](https://open.spotify.com/track/3XPD2voMhtskeDqtClsbaU?si=e6d7bb93d5264c07) by The Black Skirts
Another song I played on repeat as I was alone, in the dark, at Demonware, studying for EOSC after work. I did a lot in the summer didn't I? I'm starting to feel almost a bit proud of my ambitions back then. 

There's probably more, but these are all for now...
