I am very passionate about snacks. Good snacks carry a distinctive nostalgic factor while simultaneously attaining a high bar for quality, creativity, and addictive nature. Here are some of my favourites.

# Chinese

Let's start with what I know from childhood. These snacks are the hardest to find online because I have no idea what to search in Google and I do not remember the Chinese names. I feel like Chinese snacks are quite niche, there's too many, and only the most popular and palatable make their way to the supermarkets here. I am probably a bit more opinionated in my suggestions because I grew up with these, and the ones I am most familiar with are biased by Beijing and Shanghai.

## 脆脆鲨 (Crispy Shark Wafer)

Nostalgia. This is like a KitKat but better. Extremely thin wafers stacked into a small chocolate bar, covered in a thin layer of chocolate. Everything is light, sweet, crunchy (like the name).

## 苔条麻花 

A theme for my favourite snacks is that they have 苔条 in them. What is 苔条 (English translation: moss strips)? Essentially a type of seaweed/algae, I cannot find much information about them, but they tend to grow in the coastal regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and therefore snacks made with them can be found popularized in Shanghai. This particular snack is called 麻花, deep fried dough twisted like a braid. Addictive, and purely savory, buying these fresh would be worth it.

## 苔条饼

Another method of ingesting this umami flavor is on a slightly sweet biscuit with powdered 苔条 on it. Savory and sweet will be a big theme here. Another honorable mention is 苔条花生 (sugar, peanuts, 苔条 roasted together). It is a bit messy to eat with the powder, but I make sure to catch all the crumbs because it is the best part.

## 万年青饼干

Another iconic snack: the onion biscuit. Think of a shortbread cookie, but flavored with scallion oil. Sweet and savory in happy marriage. Printed on each cookie is a 万年青 logo (English translation: evergreen, Binomial name: Rohdea japonica). Again, I am hitting a wall trying to research the history of this snack, but I believe it was popular even in the 1950s or 80s in Shanghai.

## 蔥軋餅 (Onion Nougat Biscuit)

Technically a Taiwanese snack, these are scallion biscuits with soft nougat sandwiched in-between. The most popular of Taiwanese snacks is probably pineapple cake, which deserves all the hype, but these slightly salted crunchy crackers with sweet milky chewy nougat are a close second. At times, biting into them disentegrates the cracker, and maybe the nougat sticks to your teeth, but the flavor is worth it.

# Japanese

Japan is a powerhouse when it comes to snacks, how else are they able to take the Kit Kat and make it completely their own? First introduced to Japan in 1973 when Nestlé took on production, they now have over 300 different flavors to choose from. Pocky, first sold in 1966, has also taken over the world. In 2018 I interned in Yokosuka and every few days I would visit the snack shop near the station, hoping the employees did not recognize me for being a regular. At work, there was a small convenience store near the cafeteria and I would pick up some fruit gummies or a carton of soy milk to tide me over for the rest of the day.

## Ume Kake no Tane

Kake no tane are rice crackers with peanuts, and my all time favourite is the ume flavor. The name comes from the fact that the pieces of senbei (rice cracker) look like a seed (種, tane) of the persimmon (柿, kaki). Another fun fact: this snack is declared [official space food](https://iss.jaxa.jp/en/spacefood/about/japanese/cat5/) by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Just a heads up, I will NOT share. Imagine sweet, a bit tangy, nutty, crunchy, creamy but also salty. It is the perfect combo of texture and flavor. I would have this religiously every day when I lived in Japan.

## Nori-Shio Chipstar

I'm a sucker for seaweed anything. In this snack the delivery method is: potato chip. Chipstar does it just well enough. Greasy, crunchy, don’t save it for later because it will get stale. Another staple from my Japan internship times.

## Crystal Salty Pocky

Salt and chocolate, name a better pairing. This is the best Pocky flavor, but I will throw some honorable mentions: "Men's" flavored Pocky which is a bit more bitter, ultra-thin Pocky for its addictive factor. This one has little flecks of salt in the chocolate coating.

## Soy Milk

Soy milk isn’t typically a snack but trust me...this is the best thing you can drink any type of the day. Is it breakfast? Is it with lunch? Afternoon snack? Creamy, slightly sweet, so good. I could only remember finding this in Japan, but it comes with endless flavors. Cherry blossom, banana, sake, you name it, they probably have it.

# Korean

I'm not super well versed with Korean snacks. I know about the almonds, the honey butter chips, but don't gravitate towards them much. Living near H-Mart means I can browse the shelves pretty often, and I found some gems.

## Marine Boy (seaweed flavor)

This is crunchy, sweet, salty, umami. It’s the perfect snack that you would expect a child to eat, but so satisfying to eat as an adult too. I remember picking this out just for fun, not expecting it to be very impressive but finding it irresistible. That's the fun part of snack hunting I suppose, finding a new favourite.

## Turtle Chips

Ok this does cut up your mouth, but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make. The corn flavor is solid, safe, but the Flaming Lime flavor, which is available only in the U.S. is a fun alternative. This feels like a more recent addition to the snack world, but I can see why is has gotten so popular so fast. The sweetness that is prevalent in so many Korean snacks is here too, which is why I shy away from the dessert flavors of this chip, scared it will be too sweet.
