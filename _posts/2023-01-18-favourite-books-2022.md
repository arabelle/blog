I read 22 books in 2022 and here are some of my favourites.

## [Piranesi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50202953-piranesi) by Susanna Clarke
    
Wow. What a book. I originally started to read this a few months ago but didn’t get past the first few pages. I determined to pick it up again in November.

This is a book where it felt like the author was very clear on what she wanted to write. It had a very bold voice, so I trusted it would all make sense in the end and it did.

It was so interesting how the story unravelled. Usually with mysteries I end up being unable to stand the suspense and immediately spoil it for myself, but maybe I do that because I feel unease or there is a sense of impending doom I cannot handle. With this, I somehow felt more at peace, that Piranesi would be ok, or maybe it was just an exception.

I am sure one could write a detailed analysis of what this book meant, in a greater sense, in its metaphors. But even without that anyone can relate to the heart of it. Dealing with concepts of good and evil, the meaning of life. It felt like a very spiritual book but not magic in a way that is juvenile, in a philosophical way. The way the twists are revealed are so well done, at times I felt horror. The way the names of the characters were strangely obscure and specific. How each character, although not much known of them even at the end, somehow seemed real and full of complexity.

Piranesi is innocence, he is good, he is simple, he is human but a blank slate. He is smart and resourceful, he has flaws but give him the benefit of the doubt. He respects the dead, he does not want to hurt others, he is able to appreciate beauty, he understands the meaning of his life in the House. In that sense he basically lives in a utopia, a perfect world. The way that he treated the dead felt very immortal. Like how someone would treat the dead if they did not fear dying: in an enlightened way. Even at the end of the book, I feel a need to protect him and root for him.

This book is tender in a way I did not expect. How even this world of endless halls and statues can feel like home, like something you would not/could not leave behind. Like losing your innocence.

Some of my favourite quotes near the end:

>But she still wears the perfume - the first thing I ever knew of her - and it still makes me think of Sunlight and Happiness

>I understand much better now - better than Piranesi ever could - the magnificent thing she did in coming to find me, the magnitude of her courage

And one of my favourite parts was when he went to the Moon room and had a Revelation, realizing the beauty of the world he lived in.

>The Beauty of the House is immeasurable. Its Kindness infinite

## [Lie With Me](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40539136-lie-with-me) by Philippe Besson

This novel is about a writer’s life. 

The last page of this book made me cry, as not many books do. It was such a short passage but held so much weight.

I feel like people will want to compare this book with others, “Call Me By Your Name”, even “Brokeback Mountain”. All very crude comparisons that reduce all of these stories to one angle, I find that quite offensive. One other random quote I found a bit jarring was how the narattor talked about Shanghai being an artificial city…not sure where this opinion came from.

There are a lot of references in this book, to music and movies of the time. I generally get lazy and just take it for what it is, but this time I looked some up. I think they give a sense of the kind of person the narrator is, what he would be interested in, his intelligence and openness to who he is, his curiosity for the unconventional.

There are times in the book where the narrator tells you that he made certain details about a place or life up, as he often does make up lives for strangers walking by. At some point it made me think, how can I be sure what he is saying now is real? It gives the novel a meta-quality and a bit of surrealism.

Another choice he made was not to name his current lover, S., perhaps not to take away from the story, since his presence was not the main point, although he speaks quite highly of him. No love will replace another, it will always be a different one. There is the idea of a happiness that is never to be found again, here, and of a youth that will stay immortalized by this love, but will never be carried forward. Philippe will never love someone like he loved Thomas and vice versa… 

Thomas is elusive, afraid of himself, unable to be himself, and eventually he disappears out of necessity. Invisible in the sense that he is not dead but not present either.

## [Small Things Like These](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58662236-small-things-like-these) by Claire Keegan

Short book but one that stayed in my mind.

Right away you get the sense that Furlough is someone who gets in his head. Maybe even a bit depressed, the meaning of life is far from his reach, but at least he has his work distracting him. He has some self esteem issues, due to growing up as a child to a “fallen woman” perhaps, not having a father, feeling not good enough.

He wants to do the right things but he is also aware of his flaws. The author doesn’t discount the negative feelings or thoughts he has.

We see Eileen in survival mode, representing society as a whole in the way she wants to turn a blind eye and keep her own house running as a priority. It is a man’s privilege to stick his neck on the line to help because he has the authority and power. Furlough is trying to pay it forward, the kindness he was surrounded by in his childhood. At the end he finds his meaning, his happiness, in his act of kindness.
